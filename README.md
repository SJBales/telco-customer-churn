# Overview

Customer churn is costly to enterprises, especially in industries where costs of customer acquisition are high. Telecom companies are such entities. Customers often do not switch providers due to contractual obligations, behavioral momentum, and services are often minimally differentiated. Understanding the reasons why customers churn can allow product and customer service teams to make changes to product offerings or support to change the likelihood of customer churn, and accurately predicting which customers may churn allows those same teams to have real-time, direct mitigation strategies to retain more customers.

# Objectives

This analysis has two objectives:

    1. Use available features to determine what factors contribute to customer churn
    2. Develop a predictive model to identify which customers are most at risk to curn given current cross-sectional data
